# ocaTestCode

I am currently studying for the OCAJP8 (Oracle Certified Associate - Java Programmer I) and while bookwork is all very good, I have found it useful to consolidate my knowledge by making small commented Java classes that reinforce the concepts I am going over.

If you are also studying for OCAJP8 and have a contribution to make, feel more than welcome to make a PR.
